By default, the script simulates the GTA VI game status.

If you want change to something else, go on discord.dev, click on "Application" then "New Application", 
and name it by the things you want simulate, exemple: "Grand Theft Auto VI".

Now copy your Application ID, and past it in: app_id = ''

In discord.dev, put the icon of your simulated App in "App icon"

Then in: large_image=""
put the same file name of your icon.

You can add details in: details=""

And that's it, you can run it with a .bat file, to keep it open.
